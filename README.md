# Jammming
A project for Codecademy's React Immersive course

## Getting Started

## Project Prompt
### Features
* Spotify Login — the first time a user searches for a song, album, or artist, Spotify will ask them to log in or set up a new account. You will need to follow the steps in the Spotify Developer Guide to register your application.
* Search by Song, Album, or Artist — a user can type the name of a song, artist, or album into the search bar and click the SEARCH button. The app will request song data about the user's input from the Spotify library (find Spotify endpoints here).
* Populate Results List — Jammming displays the list of returned tracks from the user's query.
* Add Song to a Custom Playlist — users can add a track to their playlist by selecting a + sign on the right side of the track's display container.
* Remove Song from Custom Playlist — users can remove a track from their playlist by selecting a - sign on the right side of the track's display container.
* Change Playlist Title — users can change the title of their custom playlist.
* Save Playlist to Account — users can save their custom playlist by clicking a button called SAVE TO SPOTIFY.

### Resources
Because we want you to focus on building the React infrastructure, we have provided links to the HTML/CSS and visual assets below. Notice, we did not break the HTML and CSS into their components. To complete the project you will need to split the HTML/CSS into their components.

* [index.html](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/programs/react/jammming/static-html-css/indexHtml.txt) — all of the HTML for a static version of the website.
* [style.css](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/programs/react/jammming/static-html-css/indexCss.txt) — all of the CSS for a static version of the website.
* [image assets](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/programs/react/jammming/image_assets.zip) — all of the image assets used in the website.

### A final note
Whether you're up for the challenge or not, we recommend you consider the following questions before you start coding.

* What components does the application need?
* How will the application handle state?
* What methods does the application need?
* How does the application hook up to the Spotify API?
* How does the application save a playlist to a user's profile? As you complete the steps, you can compare the structure you devised to the one we use recommend in the project steps.


This is a large project. Take your time and review the earlier lessons if you run into problems. Good luck!
