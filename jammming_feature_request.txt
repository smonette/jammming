Jammming UI Improvements
July 31,  2018


OBJECTIVE
Improve app adoption by making the functionality easier to use and adopt.


BACKGROUND 
In user research sessions we’ve seen a lot of places where Jammming functionality was confusing. For example, our users struggled with:

Search
They’d often hit Enter/Return, then think search was broken when nothing happened

Updating playlist name
Many users didn’t realize the text was editable

Save playlist
Users kept clicking the button because there was no feedback that it saved, and ended up making multiple playlists once they logged into Spotify. They were also confused by the button being present when they hadn’t started to create a playlist yet.


TECHNICAL DESIGN
Search
Add a handler that listens on keypress, and if “Enter” is detected, call the search function.

Updating playlist name
This will be a simple UI change. Simply add an icon that indicates that this is editable.

 Save playlist
When the user first lands on the page, hide the button and provide some informative text.
When the user adds a song, show the button.
When the user clicks save, update the button text to tell them it’s been saved.


Caveats
The best practice would probably be to make the save button wait on a successful “Playlist saved” response. Since we’re trying to prevent the user from making duplicate playlists, I think this is a good initial approach.
